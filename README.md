# Extracting-Gene-Data
Finding the most common gene pair by analyzing file with 100,000+ lines of data.

I did this in project in Python first, but it took a while to run and we were learning C in class at the time so I decided to code the same project in C to compare the speed of C with Python and see the difference for myself. Needless to say, the program in C ran significantly faster!
